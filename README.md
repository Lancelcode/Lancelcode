### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java and SQL.
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working towards my CS degree.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any interesting open source projects to showcase my skills.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with data structures and alghorithms.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, I am always interested in collaborate with other devs.
